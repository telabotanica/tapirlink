Release 0.7.1 (2010-09-14)
--------------------------
(revision 2027)

	* Resources can now be configured to reject custom output models.
	* Concepts are now automatically mapped by default.
	* New configuration to specify accepted domains for remote file retrieval.
	* New timezone setting.
	* Minor adjustments to avoid warnings in PHP versions >= 5.3.
	* Latest DarwinCore terms added as a possible conceptual schema.

Release 0.7.0 (2009-03-21)
--------------------------
(revision 1988)

	* New admin program to check the database encoding configuration.
	* Check each piece of content that comes from the database 
	  (in search or inventory responses) to avoid wrong charset conversions that
	  may produce invalid XML. Conversion problems could happen when the database
	  charset was incorrectly configured or if the database content somehow
	  didn't follow the expected (real) database encoding.
	* Added support for mixed content elements, allowing TapirLink to be exchange
	  simple TCS (Taxonomic Concept Schema) data.
	* Fixed bug in SQL count caching mechanism when it was disabled.
	* Included basic checks when processing ping request (service configuration, 
	  database connection and runtime errors).
	* When the targetNamespace of the response structure is the RDF namespace 
	  and the envelope is turned off, TapirLink now returns the HTTP Content-type 
	  application/rdf+xml.
	* When a search returns no content and the envelope is turned off, TapirLink 
	  now returns HTTP 204 (No Content).
	* Added support to "IN" operator in KVP filters.
	* New TP_DIAG_LEVEL option can be used to control diagnostics display.
	* Fixed bug when importing DiGIR configuration (resource entity was not being
	  imported and all contacts were accumulating in the host entity across
	  different resources).
	* Replaced XML schema location used in responses with: 
	  http://rs.tdwg.org/tapir/1.0/schema/tdwg_tapir.xsd
	* Added new metadata fields: entity type, region code, country code and zip code.
	* Fixed bug when deserializing bibliographic citation.
	* Added support to the new <rootElement> feature in output model definitions.

Release 0.6.1 (2008-08-01)
--------------------------
(revision 746)

	* Added support for automatic updates.
	* Bugfix: dateLastUpdated environment variable was not working if it
	  was mapped to a field with a datatype other than datetime.
	* Removed unnecessary verification to check if session.save_path is writable
	  when running the configurator.
	* Included caching mechanism for count SQL in inventories and searches. Can
	  be controlled with TP_SQL_COUNT_CACHE_LIFE_SECS.

Release 0.6.0 (2008-04-30)
--------------------------
(revision 660)

	* Bugfix: When different configuration interfaces from different 
	  TapirLink installations were being accessed through the same browser,
	  session caching was not making any distinction between them.
	* Users now need to explicitly choose the conceptual schema format when
	  trying to load an additional conceptual schema in the configuration 
	  interface (mapping form).
	* When loading concepts from a CNS configuration file (old text format), if the 
	  concept_source alias was not specified then the last concept_source
	  will be loaded.
	* Bugfix: Resuming the inclusion of new resources was probably not working 
	  correctly in previous versions.
	* Configuration interface can now make use of debug logging.
	* Bugfix: KVP filters were not working properly on PHP 4.x when they had
	  nested parenthesis.
	* Many adjustments in the statistics module.
	* Fixed bug that was affecting KVP requests when parameter names were in uppercase.
	* Included missing "charset=utf-8" in the HTTP header.
	* Flush cache after any change in the local mapping.
	* Resources are not serialized in session anymore when running the web service.
	* Bugfix: Empty tagname parameters (inventory operation) were not being ignored.
	* Bugfix: Output models were failing to produce results when the indexing
	  element had a simple type.
	* Bugfix: Searches were failing when the parameter "limit" was not specified
	  (default was being set to zero instead of null).
	* Follow up protocol update: Filter condition will now be ignored when parameter
	  is not passed. When a concept is not locally mapped, the error will now only be
	  raised if there's no missing parameter.
	* Bugfix: KVP filters were not working if they contained any of the following
	  operators: lessthan, lessthanorequals, greaterthan, greaterthanorequals.
	* Bugfix: Search XML requests referencing external templates were not working.
	* Updated local version of ADODB to 4.98.
	* Changed DiGIR configuration import procedure to overcome an XML parsing problem
	  (or maybe it's a feature?) that sometimes splits a string and calls the character
	  data handler for each individual piece of the string. This was happening when
	  DiGIR metadata content contained diacriticals.
	* Implemented driver to load concepts in the old DarwinCore format (tied to DiGIR).
	* Created separate library for Xs classes.
	* Included new settings TP_LOCAL_REPOSITORY (to indicate where local copies
	  of remote files may be found if manually copied there) and
	  TP_FILE_RETRIEVAL_BEHAVIOUR (prefer_original, prefer_local or only_local).
	* Implemented driver to load concepts in the new CNS XML format.
	* Added support to case sensitive dabatabase schemas.
	* Bugfix: Now each resource has its separate cache directory.
	* Bugfix: When a node contained a concatenated mapping, it was being rejected.
	  if one of the mappings evaluated to NULL.
	* Added alias support for output models.
	* Capabilities response now includes the local datatype for each mapped concept.^M
	* Removed ConceptNameServers element from capabilities response.^M
	* Bugfix: log-only requests were not working for search and inventory operations.^M
	* Bugfix: "next" attribute was not being included in the search summary when^M
	  no records were returned.
	* Added xsd:dateTime to db timestamp conversion in filters.
	* Added db timestamp to xsd:dateTime conversion in search and inventory responses.
	* Bugfix: Fixed value mappings using numeric type zero were not working.

Release 0.5 (2007-09-09)
------------------------
(revision 434)

	* Configuration interface can now make use of existing equivalent mappings
	  when clicking on the "automap" button.
	* Added alias support for query templates.
	* Caching of query templates, output models and response structures is now
	  activated by default (there were many bugfixes related with caching).
	* Bugfix: Complex types without content type but with attributes were not 
	  working in response structures.
	* Bugfix: Attribute references were not working in response structures using
	  PHP 4.x.
	* Bugfix: Choices in response structures were not working properly when the
	  first option had no content (thanks to Kevin Richards for the fix).
	* Bugfix: Generic response cache was not working.

	  in response structures.
	* Bugfix: Inventories with multiple concepts were not working before
	  this release.
	* Bugfix: TAPIR environment variable lastUpdated was renamed to lastUpdate.
	* Bugfix: Searches with inline output models were not working when response
	  structures involved multiple namespaces.
	* Bugfix: XML Schema "include" and "import" constructs now work with all 
	  kinds of relative locations (thanks to Roger Hyam).
	* Removed the limitation that namespaces must be associated with only one 
	  XML Schema.
	* Bugfix: Searches and inventories with limit = 0 were not working.
	* Implemented automapping.
	* Bugfix: Filter comparisons involving concepts that had an underlying fixed
	  value mapping might not work if the value type was numeric.
	* Concepts can now be locally mapped to TAPIR environment variables.
	* Bugfix: Element bibliographicCitation in metadata responses was using a
	  wrong namespace.
	* Bugfix: Elements relatedInformation, hasContact and geo:Point were in 
	  wrong order in metadata responses.
	* Bugfix: Attribute startTime in the indexingPreferences element (metadata
	  response) was in a wrong format.

	* Added support to LSID resolution.
	* Made necessary adjustments to work with an RDF representation of
	  DarwinCore as a response structure.
	* Bugfix related to the representation of concept ids in the capabilities 
	  response (existing providers will need to regenerate the capabilities 
	  configuration file by saving again the local mapping using the configurator).
